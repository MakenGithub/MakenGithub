👋 Hi, I’m @MakenGithub

🌍 I’m from Argentina, studying Computer Engineering at the UNNOBA (National University of the Northwest of Buenos Aires Province). I am fluent in Spanish and currently learning English.

👀 I’m interested in software development for microcontrollers and embedded systems. I specialize in C++ and Assembler programming languages. I also have an interest in home automation and IoT, and although I’m a beginner in this area, I plan to dedicate myself to it in the future.

🌱 Currently, I’m practicing with the PIC16F84A microcontroller, using simulation tools like EMU8086 and MPLab for coding, and Proteus to visualize circuit functionality. My goal is to move on to working with sensors and actuators, applying my knowledge to the real world.

💞️ I would like to collaborate on projects related to embedded systems, IoT, or home automation, especially those involving development in C++ or Assembler. Although I don’t have experience collaborating on open-source projects yet, I’m open to learning opportunities and contributing my skills.

⚡ Fun fact: I’m passionate about MMA and practice this sport; although I’ve tried other sports, this one is definitely for me. My favorite fighter is Khabib Nurmagomedov, but my style leans more towards striking. I have skills in public speaking; I completed my secondary education with a degree in Social Sciences and Humanities and have participated in local and provincial assemblies and open-mic parliaments. Initially, I thought I would dedicate my life to this area, but everything changed when I wrote my first HTML code in a text editor, which sparked my interest in computing and led me to study Computer Engineering.
